# Maker Skills: Mouse Violin 

This project explores the possibility of musical expression through the use of a computer mouse.

Software instruments that imitate acoustic instruments have been around for a while now. Altough the research on physical modeling of instruments stretches far beyond musical applicability, some interesting vsts, libraries and tools have been developed to put to use these ideas. One of those libraries is [The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/ "The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)").
