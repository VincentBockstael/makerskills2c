# Maker Skills: Mouse Violin 

Musical expression is a bottleneck for imitating an acoustic isntruments with digital synthesis. Apart from fluid dynamics and pitchbends, we are missing out on the instrument dependent characteristics. Such as the expression caused by breath and pressure in a clarinet or the bowing position and velocity in a violin. The combination of persueing these instrument dependent characteristics and defining a framework for expression might just be the solution achieve a realistic imitation of acoustic instruments. 

This project explores the possibility of musical expression of a digital violin through the use of a computer mouse. 

Software instruments that imitate acoustic instruments have been around for a while now. Altough the research on physical modeling of instruments stretches far beyond musical applicability, some interesting vsts, libraries and tools have been developed to put to use these ideas. One of those libraries is [The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/ "The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)").
